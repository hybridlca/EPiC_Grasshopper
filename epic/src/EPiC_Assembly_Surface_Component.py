"""
Creates a surface assembly based on the selected geometry and EPiC Materials

    Inputs:
        Assembly_Name: Name for the assembly - this will appear in data EPiC Built Assets and reports.
        ***Optional***

        Assembly_Category: Name for the assembly category. Will use assembly name if none specified.
        Note that assemblies in the same category will be grouped together in the EPiC Built Assets.
        ***Optional***

        Assembly_Comments: Comments about the assembly - these will appear in the data EPiC Built Assets and reports.
        ***Optional***

        **Selected_Surfaces_(m²): A selection of surfaces that represent the EPiC Assembly.
        An area calculation will be performed on objects to calculate embodied environmental flows.
        (**REQUIRED)

        Service_Life_(Years)_Assembly_Override: Estimated service_life (in years) for the assembly.
        Note this will override all material service_life attributes.
        ***Optional***

        Wastage_Coefficient_(%)_Assembly_Override: Estimated wastage percentage (%) for the material.
        Note this will override all material wastage attributes.
        ***Optional***

    Outputs:
        EPiC_Assembly: Outputs a class object (EPiC_Assembly) to be used in EPiC_Analysis.
        This contains all of the embedded assembly attributes.
        (selected_geometry, name, thickness, service_life, wastage, comments, epic_materials, assembly_units)
        ***Connect that output to a panel for a summary***

        Initial_Embodied_Energy_(MJ): The total initial Embodied Energy (MJ) for the assembly.
        This includes the wastage coefficient but does NOT include service_life calculations.

        Initial_Embodied_Water_(L): The total initial Embodied Water (L) for the assembly.
        This includes the wastage coefficient but does NOT include service_life calculations.

        Initial_Embodied_GHG_(kgCO₂e): The total initial Embodied Greenhouse Gas Emissions (kgCO₂e) for the assembly.
        This includes the wastage coefficient but does NOT include service_life calculations.

        Geometry: The geometry used to define the assembly.
