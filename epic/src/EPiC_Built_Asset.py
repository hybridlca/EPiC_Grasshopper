"""
Creates a built asset object using multiple EPiC_Assembly items

    Inputs:

        Asset_Name: Name for the Built Asset
        ***Optional***

        EPiC_Assemblies: In input one or more EPiC_Assembly objects
        (**REQUIRED)

    Outputs:
        EPiC_Built_Asset: Built Asset class with detailed report
        ***Connect that output to a panel for a summary***
