Creates a custom material using custom environmental flows

    Inputs:
        Material_Name: Name of the material- this will appear in the printed/exported reports
        ***Optional***

        Material_Category: Name of the material category
        ***Optional***

        **Functional_Unit_(m,m²,m³,kg,no.): Functional unit for the material (e.g m, m² ,m³,no. or kg)
        (**REQUIRED)

        Density_(kg/m³): The density of the material in kg/m³
        ***Optional***

        **Embodied_Energy_Coefficient_(MJ/FU): The embodied energy coefficient for the material in MJ/Functional Unit
        (**REQUIRED)

        **Embodied_Water_Coefficient_(L/FU): The embodied water coefficient for the material in L/Functional Unit
        (**REQUIRED)

        **Embodied_GHG_Coefficient_(kgCO₂e/FU): The embodied greenhouse gas emissions coefficient for the material
        in kgCO₂e/Functional Unit
        (**REQUIRED)

        Wastage_Coefficient_(%): Estimated wastage percentage (%) for the material.
        0 indicates no wastage, 100 indicates 100% wastage.
        ***Optional***

        Material_Service_Life_(Years): Estimated service_life (in years) for the material.
        0 indicates that the material will never need to be replaced
        ***Optional***

        Comments: Comments about the material - these will appear in the printed/exported reports.
        ***Optional***

    Outputs:
        Custom_Material: Outputs a class object (CustomMaterial) containing all of the embedded material attributes:
        (name, energy, water, ghg, functional_unit, doi, category, material_id, wastage, service_life, comments)
        ***Connect that output to a panel for a summary***

        Embodied_Energy_Coefficient_(MJ/FU): The Embodied Energy Coefficient for this material.
        Note this does not include wastage in the calculation

        Embodied_Water_Coefficient_(L/FU): The Embodied Water Coefficient for this material.
        Note this does not include wastage in the calculation

        Embodied_GHG_Coefficient_(kgCO₂e/FU): The Embodied Greenhouse Gas Emissions Coefficient for this material.
        Note this does not include wastage in the calculation

        Density_(kg/m³): Material density, as provided in the EPiC Database

        Functional_Unit: Functional Unit, as provided in the EPiC Database

        Wastage_Coefficient_(%): Estimated wastage percentage (%) for the material.
        This will use the default value for the material (if it exists in the database), otherwise it will default to 0.
        0 indicates no wastage, 100 indicates 100% wastage

        Material_Service_Life_(Years): Estimated service_life (in years) for the material.
        This will use the default value for the material (if it exists in the database), otherwise it will default to 0.
        0 indicates that the material will never need to be replaced
