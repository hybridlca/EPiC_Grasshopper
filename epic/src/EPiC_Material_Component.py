Select a material from the EPiC Database

    Inputs:
        >>**Connect_Toggle_Switch_to_Activate: Connect a toggle switch and set to 'True' to activate this component.
        (**REQUIRED)

        **Material_Category: Once the EPiC Material component has been activated,
        a value list will be automatically generated with pre-filled categories wired to this input.
        *** To reset this input, delete any connected wires, and re-activate the button ***

        **Selected_Material: Once the EPiC Material component has been activated,
        a value list will be automatically generated with pre-filled materials, based on the selected category (above).
        *** To reset this input, delete any connected wires, and re-activate the button ***

        Wastage_Coefficient_(%): Estimated wastage percentage (%) for the material.
        This will use the default value for the material (if it exists in the database), otherwise it will default to 0.
        0 indicates no wastage, 100 indicates 100% wastage.
        ***Optional***

        Material_Service_Life_(Years): Estimated service_life (in years) for the material.
        This will use the default value for the material (if it exists in the database), otherwise it will default to 0.
        0 indicates that the material will never need to be replaced.
        ***Optional***

        Energy_Reduction_Factor_(%): Reduce the value of the energy coefficient by a percentage
        0(%) indicates no change, 50(%) half of the value, and 100(%) reduces the energy coefficient to zero
        ***Optional***

        Water_Reduction_Factor_(%): Reduce the value of the water coefficient by a percentage
        0(%) indicates no change, 50(%) half of the value, and 100(%) reduces the water coefficient to zero
        ***Optional***

        GHG_Reduction_Factor_(%): Reduce the value of the GHG emissions coefficient by a percentage
        0(%) indicates no change, 50(%) half of the value, and 100(%) reduces the GHG emissions coefficient to zero
        ***Optional***
        Comments: Comments about the material - these will appear in the printed/exported reports.
        ***Optional***

        >>Connect_Toggle_Switch_to_Open_EPiC_Database: Connect a toggle switch and set to True.
        This will open https://bit.ly/EPiC_Database in a web browser

    Outputs:
        EPiC_Material: Outputs a class object (EPiCMaterial) containing all of the embedded material attributes:
        (name, energy, water, ghg, functional_unit, doi, category, material_id, wastage, service_life, comments)
        ***Connect that output to a panel for a summary***

        Embodied_Energy_Coefficient_(MJ/FU): The Embodied Energy Coefficient for this material.
        Values are imported from the EPiC Database
        ***Note this does not include wastage in the calculation***

        Embodied_Water_Coefficient_(L/FU): The Embodied Water Coefficient for this material.
        Values are imported from the EPiC Database.
        ***Note this does not include wastage in the calculation***

        Embodied_GHG_Coefficient_(kgCO₂e/FU): The Embodied Greenhouse Gas Emissions Coefficient for this material.
        Values are imported from the EPiC Database.
        ***Note this does not include wastage in the calculation***

        Digital Object Identifier (DOI): A link to the material information sheet in the EPiC Database

        Density_(kg/m³): Material density, as provided in the EPiC Database

        Functional_Unit: Functional Unit, as provided in the EPiC Database

        Wastage_Coefficient_(%): Estimated wastage percentage (%) for the material.
        This will use the default value for the material (if it exists in the database), otherwise it will default to 0.
        0 indicates no wastage, 100 indicates 100% wastage

        Material_Service_Life_(Years): Estimated service_life (in years) for the material.
        This will use the default value for the material (if it exists in the database), otherwise it will default to 0.
        0 indicates that the material will never need to be replaced
